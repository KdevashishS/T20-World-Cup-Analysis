# T20-World-Cup-Analysis
Created a Power BI report to identify the top 11 players for a T20 cricket team by scraping data from ESPNCricinfo using the Bright data tool, Cleaning and transforming the data with pandas and evaluated various player performance metrics.
Utilized the Power BI dashboard to categorize players into roles (openers, middle-order/anchors, finishers, all-rounders, specialist fast bowlers) and select the top 11 players for the match.
The selected team has a 90% chance of winning the game.
